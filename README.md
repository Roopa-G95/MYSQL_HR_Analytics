# SQL-Based Data Validation for Power BI HR Analytics Report

## OBJECTIVE
The objective is to create a comprehensive HR database in MySQL, write SQL queries to support effective analysis, and develop a test documentation to QA the HR analytics dashboard built in Power BI. This initiative aims to provide standardized, insightful metrics and visualizations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and improved workforce management.

## Requirements

### Functional Validation

Validate each feature in the HR analytics dashborad function according to the defined requirements. This includes verifying all the filters, including demographic filters (gender, department, education filed) and action filters. Also check the customized insights and analysis of employee data such as attrition rates and job satisfaction.

### Data Validation

Ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data used in the HR dashboard by cross-referencing the values displayed in the PowerBI report with the results from the corresponding SQL queries. This will involve checking the employee data, job satisfaction scores and demographic information is correctly represented and matches the source data in the HR database.

### Test documentation

Prepare comprehensive test documentation that includes detailed screenshots, the SQL queries used for validation and the steps taken to verify each report's functionality. The documentation also ouline any discrepencies found during teasting and provide evidence of the validation process to ensure the reports meet the specified requirements for effective HR data analysis and decision-Making.
